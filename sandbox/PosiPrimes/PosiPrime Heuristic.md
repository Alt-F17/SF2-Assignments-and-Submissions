Heuristic Argument for the Infinitude of PosiPrimes
Definition
A PosiPrime is defined as a prime number ( p_n ), the ( n )-th prime in the sequence of primes (e.g., ( p_1 = 2 ), ( p_2 = 3 ), ( p_3 = 5 ), etc.), such that the decimal representation of ( p_n ) contains the decimal representation of its position ( n ) as a substring. For example:

( n = 7 ): ( p_7 = 17 ), and "7" is a substring of "17".
( n = 6455 ): ( p_{6455} = 64553 ), and "6455" is a substring of "64553".

The question is whether the set ( S = { n \mid p_n \text{ contains } n \text{ as a substring} } ) is infinite.
Background
By the Prime Number Theorem, the ( n )-th prime ( p_n ) is approximately:[p_n \approx n \log n]where ( \log ) denotes the natural logarithm. The number of digits of ( p_n ), denoted ( d(p_n) ), is:[d(p_n) = \lfloor \log_{10} p_n \rfloor + 1 \approx \lfloor \log_{10} (n \log n) \rfloor + 1]Using the property ( \log_{10} (n \log n) = \log_{10} n + \log_{10} \log n ), and since ( \log_{10} \log n ) is small for large ( n ), ( d(p_n) ) is slightly larger than the number of digits of ( n ), ( d(n) = \lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1 ).
Heuristic Approach
To determine if there are infinitely many PosiPrimes, we estimate the probability that ( p_n ) contains ( n ) as a substring and analyze the expected number of such occurrences over all ( n ).
Step 1: Probability Estimation
Consider ( p_n ) as a string of ( d(p_n) ) digits and ( n ) as a string of ( d(n) ) digits. The number of possible starting positions for ( n ) within ( p_n ) is:[d(p_n) - d(n) + 1]For each position, the probability that the ( d(n) ) digits of ( p_n ) match the ( d(n) ) digits of ( n ) is:[\left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^{d(n)}]assuming the digits of ( p_n ) behave as if randomly distributed (a simplification we will justify later).
Thus, the probability ( P_n ) that ( p_n ) contains ( n ) as a substring is approximately:[P_n \approx \left( d(p_n) - d(n) + 1 \right) \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^{d(n)}]
Step 2: Asymptotic Behavior
For large ( n ):

( d(n) = \lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1 \approx \log_{10} n )
( d(p_n) \approx \log_{10} (n \log n) = \log_{10} n + \log_{10} \log n )
( d(p_n) - d(n) + 1 \approx (\log_{10} n + \log_{10} \log n) - \log_{10} n + 1 = \log_{10} \log n + 1 ), which grows slowly.

Also:[\left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^{d(n)} = 10^{-d(n)} \approx 10^{-\log_{10} n} = \frac{1}{n}]So:[P_n \approx (\log_{10} \log n + 1) \cdot \frac{1}{n}]Let ( c_n = \log_{10} \log n + 1 ), a slowly increasing function. Then:[P_n \approx \frac{c_n}{n}]
Step 3: Expected Number of PosiPrimes
The expected number of PosiPrimes is the sum of ( P_n ) over all ( n ):[E = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P_n \approx \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{n}]Since ( c_n > 1 ) and increases (albeit slowly), compare this to the harmonic series:[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}]which diverges. The series ( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{n} ) diverges faster because ( c_n \geq 1 ) and grows, suggesting that the expected number of PosiPrimes is infinite.
Justification of Randomness Assumption
While prime digits are not truly random, results like the normality of the sequence of primes (conjectured but not fully proven) and empirical evidence suggest that digit patterns in primes are sufficiently unpredictable. Moreover, for fixed substrings, Dirichletâ€™s theorem implies infinitely many primes exist with any given digit sequence, supporting the plausibility of our heuristic.
Limitations
This is not a formal proof because:

The digits of ( p_n ) are not independent or uniformly random.
( P_n ) is an approximation, and dependencies between ( n ) and ( p_n ) are complex.
A rigorous proof requires showing that the actual number of PosiPrimes (not just the expected number) is infinite, possibly via construction or sieve methods.

Conclusion
While a complete proof or disproof remains open, the divergence of ( \sum P_n ) provides a strong heuristic indication that there are infinitely many PosiPrimes. Advanced techniques in analytic number theory are needed for rigor.
