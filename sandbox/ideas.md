# Ideas for SF2 - Study Tools (2025)

# EVERYTHING IN A SINGLE FILE!!! (end me... please...)

- [X] Word Jumble
DONE


- [X] Flashcards
DONE


- [X] Louisa ConcepTests
DONE


- [ ] Stack VS Queue
Split screen into two sections, one for stack and one for queue.
Code snippets for each data structure.
Challenge to make both stacks contain the same elements in the same order.


- [ ] Pandas DataFrame playground with small datasets
Simple Dataset of simulated grades for Louisa's class.
Challenge to go from X = assigned grades, Y = Student names, to opposite using Pandas.
Challenge to graph the grades for each student using Matplotlib. 



- [ ] "Spot the Bug" challenges with common Python errors



- [ ] 2D list pattern generator and manipulator



- [ ] File I/O simulation sandbox
Side bar containing a list of files and their types.
Challenge to read a file and print the contents to the console.
Challenge to take in the contents of a file and write them to a new file with a different name and format.
Challenge to take in the contents of a file and write them to a JSON file.


- [ ] Error handling simulator (delete if resembles ConcepTests too much)
Simulate a program that throws an error.
Identify the error (MCQ) and explain what it is.
Challenge to fix the error using try/except blocks.
Have 2-3 problems per major error 

- [ ] OOP class hierarchy diagram builder
Use animal heirarchy as an example.
Create a class diagram of the animal hierarchy.
Create animals in subclasses and show the relationships between them.


- [ ] Sorting algorithm step-by-step animator
Depends on what we will see this week
Create a visual representation of a sorting algorithm.
Time = 0.7s per step.
Explination for each step of the algorithm.
Algorithms to include: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort.


- [ ] Recursive function step-by-step animator
IDEM:
Create a visual representation of a recursive algorithm.
Time = 0.7s per step.
Explination for each step of the algorithm.
Algorithms to include: Fibonacci, Factorial, Binary search, 


- [ ] Space/Time Complexity calculator for custom algorithms // visualizer
For a typed snipper of code, go line by line and calculate the space and time complexity of each line.
Show the final complexity of the entire code snippet and explain the results.
ERRORS: Let the user know if the code is not valid Python or if it is not a valid algorithm.


- [X] Python terminal emulator for practice
DONE


- [ ] Python concept map navigator
Floating concept map of Python concepts and their relationships.
Drag around the map to see how concepts are related.
Short description of each concept when hovered.


- [X] Other / More Ressources
DONE
